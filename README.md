# zkPoD-params

This repo hosts public parameters for [zkPoD-node](https://github.com/sec-bit/zkPoD-node) - a decentralized system for perfect fair data exchange.

Folder [zksnark_key](zksnark_key/) holds zkPoD zkSNARK parameters, including the proving key and verifying key.

It is generated by the *trusted setup* in [zkPoD-lib](https://github.com/sec-bit/zkPoD-lib/blob/2ba770ac526c233ae8c9c7bdf401f4b9cc18c99c/pod_setup/atomic_swap_vc_keypair_generator.cc#L77). **But it is only for testing purpose by now and should not be trusted.**

We may need a ceremony for zkSNARK public parameter generation [like Zcash did](https://z.cash/technology/paramgen) or join an MPC ceremony like [gnosis/powersoftau](https://github.com/gnosis/powersoftau#instructions) shortly.
